Sandbox
------
The sandbox is ready! Head over to http://vbuck.github.io/change-js-api/ to play around to make real requests to Change.org using your API keys, and generate the code you need to get started.

Please use an HTML5 browser for the sandbox. I didn't feel like building for old technology. Thanks!
